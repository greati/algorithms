A Red-Black Tree is a binary search tree which keeps, in its nodes,
an extra bit of information: the color of the node.

The properties are the following:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Every node is either red or black.
	\item The root is black.
	\item Every leaf is black (NIL)
	\item If a node is red, then both its children are black.
	\item For each node, every path from the node to descendant 
	leaf has the same number of black nodes.

\end{itemize}

The \textbf{black-height}, $bh(r)$, is defined to be the amount of black nodes in the path from
the root $r$ to a leaf, not including $r$. 

It's possible to prove that the height of a RBT is at most $2\log(n + 1)$.
